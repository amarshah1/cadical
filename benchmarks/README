After building '../sadical' run './runs.sh' or execute 'make'.  This will
run '../sadical' on all the test cases listed in './run.sh' and check
whether the expected result is obtained.  If the formula is satisfiable
the output is checked to be a correct witness using the 'precochk' tool.
If the formula is unsatisfiable a proof is generated and checked with the
'dpr-trim' tool.  Both tools are included as source and build first.
